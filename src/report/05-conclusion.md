# Conclusion

There a few takeaways from the analysis:

* In order to better understand drug prescription quantity how prescriptions
  are stored needs to be rethought. It's hard to conclude which medicine has
  been prescribed more overall, or which practice has prescribed the highest
  **actual** amount of [insert medicine here]. The chemicals do not carry any
  information regarding dosage in a way that is easily parsable.

* There aren't as many patients in _N17_ as I expected.

* Whatever _beta-blockers_ actually are, _Burrswood Nursing Home_ must have a
  lot of people needing them. At a whooping 161 bb/p they are leading the
  charge on that type of drug.

* We can see massive gaps on money spent per patient, it ranges from _0.17£_ to
  over _1M£_.

* As far as SSRIs go, the fluctuation between months seems to be minimal (less
  than 1%).
